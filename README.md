These are the first official coding projects I have started working on since starting my Masters with the help of my professor and tutors, I have created this Github to track my progress and my coding experiences. The projects might not be perfect but they are the first step in the newest chapter of my life

Just for references ive listed the projects and the assignment tasks that were required for each project below:

Project#1 - Asks for the user name, age, and current year to output users name,age and birth year

Project#2 - Asks the user a number as a string (to set a max number of digits is ok);Your program should ask which is the base (an Integer from 2 to 16); With that information, your program should compute the binary and decimal representations of the number, then print it out as a string

Project#3 - Program asks the user a scale factor A and a common ratio R; Your program inform the user if the GP informed converges to a sum
regardless of its number of elements:If the GP converges to a sum regardless of the number of elements,your program should compute the sum of infinite elements;Otherwise, your program should ask the number of elements n, and compute the sum of all elements; With that information, your program should print out the first 3 elements of the GP and the computed sum (example in the next slide).

Project#4 - Write a Python program to compute and print the arrangements of Multisets of k elements out of n that:Asks the user a number of subsets (no smaller than 3, no greater than 8);the size of each subset (from 1 to 5);total number of the arrangement (a number smaller than the sum of sizes of the subsets - n)

Project#5 - Writing a Python program to print Pascals triangle

Project#6 - Write a Python program that receives two matrices, your program should then verify if those two matrices are inverses of each other

Project#7 - Write a Python program that receives information about a lottery game based
on the player guessing k numbers out of n possible numbers.
